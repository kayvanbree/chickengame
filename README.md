# Barn Harm

Barnharm is a game in which chickens have taken over a small country area. Four farmers have figured out that the chickens can be mind controlled and are able to take on the other rival barns. The goal of the game is for the players to take over chickens and command them to attack the other barns. The last barn standing wins the game.
